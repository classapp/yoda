ClassApp's React Tutorial - WebApp created to teach people how to work with React.

Look for another branches and follow the steps to reproduce or install and run.

## Objectives

The main objective of this tutorial is to teach how to build a simple app using React.

This app uses the SWAPI - Star Wars API as data source and it is a good example about how to use some common React/JavaScript libraries and tools, specifically designed to challenge beginners during its reproduction.  

## Project description

The tasks of this tutorial are:
1. Create a React project and setup its routes
2. Create the search page (home), search the person using the SWAPI API (link to docs below) and show the results
3. Open a new page containing the details of a selected item on the result list

## Install and run

To install and run the implementation example app:
* Clone the repo
* Enter the project directory
* Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies
* Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to execute the App

## Extra challenges

* Display other infos related to the person on details screen. Example: Related films
* Allow the user to select the search type (films, vehicles, starships...) and build a detail screen for each type
* Make results section a reusable component that can be used by any search type
* Make details page a reusable component that can be used by any search type
